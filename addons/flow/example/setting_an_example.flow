Hello there!
Welcome to Flow, a simple code-first dialog system.

    - How does it work?
    - Could you repeat that?
        Gotcha.
        => INTRODUCTION
    - What does code-first mean?
        => CODE-FIRST
    - {player == speaker} Hey, I'm Bittorn too!
        Really? What a coincidence!
    - I'm already familiar
        Great! Guess I'll take my leave then.
        => END

* Let's continue.
